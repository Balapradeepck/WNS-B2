    "\n",
    "**Background:**  \n",
    "Managing personal finances is essential, and one of the first steps in doing so is keeping track of daily expenses. As a beginner in Python, you will create a simple application that allows users to input their daily expenses and view their remaining budget.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Input:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    -   The program should start by asking the user for their total budget for the month.\n",
    "    -   Each day, the user can input their daily expenses in various categories (e.g., food, transportation, entertainment).\n",
    "2.  **Process:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    -   The program should keep a running total of the expenses.\n",
    "    -   After each input, the program should update the total expenses and subtract it from the monthly budget to show the remaining budget.\n",
    "3.  **Output:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    -   Display the total amount spent so far.\n",
    "    -   Display the remaining budget.\n",
    "    -   If the user tries to spend more than their remaining budget, the program should display a warning message.\n",

    "    -   Allow users to categorize their expenses and display a breakdown of expenses by category.\n",

    "### Problem Statement 9: **Expense Tracker**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:**  \n",
    "Create a Python program that allows users to track their expenses, categorize them, and analyze their spending patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Background:**  \n",
    "Managing personal finances involves keeping track of expenses and categorizing them to understand spending habits. In this problem, you will build an expense tracker that lets users add, remove, and view expenses by category, as well as calculate total and category-specific expenditures.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Input:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    -   The program should provide a menu with the following options:\n",
    "        1.  Add a new expense.\n",
    "        2.  Remove an expense.\n",
    "        3.  View all expenses.\n",
    "        4.  View expenses by category.\n",
    "        5.  Calculate total expenses.\n",
    "        6.  Calculate total expenses by category.\n",
    "        7.  Exit the program.\n",
    "2.  **Process:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    -   Create a list to store expenses. Each expense should be a dictionary containing the following keys:\n",
    "        -   `description`: A brief description of the expense.\n",
    "        -   `amount`: The amount spent.\n",
    "        -   `category`: The category of the expense (e.g., \"Food\", \"Transportation\", \"Entertainment\").\n",
    "    -   Implement functions for each menu option:\n",
    "        -   `add_expense(expenses)`: Adds a new expense to the list.\n",
    "        -   `remove_expense(expenses, description)`: Removes an expense from the list based on the description.\n",
    "        -   `view_expenses(expenses)`: Displays all expenses in the list.\n",
    "        -   `view_expenses_by_category(expenses, category)`: Displays expenses filtered by a specific category.\n",
    "        -   `calculate_total_expenses(expenses)`: Calculates and displays the total amount of all expenses.\n",
    "        -   `calculate_total_by_category(expenses, category)`: Calculates and displays the total amount spent in a specific category.\n",
    "    -   Use loops to display the menu repeatedly until the user chooses to exit.\n",
    "    -   Use `if-elif-else` statements to handle user inputs and validate entries (e.g., ensuring the amount is a positive number, checking for valid categories).\n",
    "3.  **Output:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    -   Display appropriate messages based on the user's actions, such as confirmation when an expense is added or removed.\n",
    "    -   Show a list of expenses with their description, amount, and category when viewing expenses.\n",
    "    -   Display the total amount spent across all expenses or within a specific category.\n",
    "4.  **Bonus Features:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    -   Allow the user to sort expenses by amount or date.\n",
    "    -   Save the list of expenses to a file and allow the user to load expenses from a file when starting the program."
